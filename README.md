# React Todo List

A simple todo list made with React. You can add a task, use the newly created checkbox to line it through, and suppress any task with the trash icon.
I'll add more functionnalities later such as a sort by "checked" state, a dark/light mode toggle button and the back-end so every task is sent to a remote server.

### Main features :

- mapping
- state hook
- array manipulation
